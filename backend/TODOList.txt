DONE: Test to see if the event is being emitted correctly
       --> second topic is the address of the sender

DONE: keepalive the websocket connection for infura
DONE: redo the ddb table design to be
    --> wallet_address, name, advertisement, created_at, total_burned
DONE: test connection with ddb and the methods for ddb
- Idempotency for events
DONE: Currently getting double update for a single event. Need fixing
    - was because was using callback function AND a promise()
- think about all the fail scenarios that could happen
    - events not being processed; server goes down for a time being or something
    - duplicate events
        - race condition
        DONE: idempotency idea (if settled, do nothing)
    - sequential ordering of events and their subsequent ordering (lets not
      worry about this rn)
    - Handle the case in which pending transaction doesn't exist (logs say pending
    txn handled successfully but we see error in the actual ddb thing)
DONE: Uppercase the request including 0x for the key
DONE: Websocket still disconnects
DONE: Total burned by day for ddb table
